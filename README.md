The goal of this project is to create a game in 3D using raycasting !

It involves using C programming language and SDL2. 

It is a good learning project and the combination of all these programmes produces amazing results


The Maze is an immersive 3D game created with SDL and Raycasting technology.

To play the game, you must run make in your terminal. 

This will produce an executable file called play.

You then run ./play maze, where maze is your map (saved in maps directory).

Within the game's map, players have the freedom to navigate in any of the four cardinal directions using the W, A, S, and D keys.


Explorers can seamlessly maneuver through the intricate maze, adjusting their path by turning left or right according to their preference.

In the event of a collision with a wall, players must modify their direction before proceeding, as movement becomes restricted.

Furthermore, players have the unique capability to simultaneously move in multiple directions and rotate within the game environment, enhancing their gameplay experience.
