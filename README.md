Navigation

To navigate through the maze, players need to be mindful of the walls. 

If a player encounters a wall, they are unable to move through it and must change their direction to continue exploring. 

The maze is designed to challenge players with its twists and turns.

W: Move forward

S: Move backward

A: Rotate view to the left
